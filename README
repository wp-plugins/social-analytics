 - Press "Create New App" in the top right corner.
 - For "App Display Name" enter anything you want; I used "SocialAnalytics". You can leave the App Namespace blank.<br /> Check the box to agree to the FB Policies and on to the next page.
 - The next stage is pretty easy, just enter your domain in both the "App Domain" and "Website" sections.
